## Describe a time when you worked on a project as part of a team where there was a difference of opinion causing delays. How were you able to find a solution?

For one of my software engineering group projects in college, we had a difference in opinion for what we should use for the front-end and back-end of a web app. To solve this problem I decided to list reasons why the frameworks I thought we should use and encouraged others to do the same. We then put it to a vote.

## When did you last coordinate your work with others in a team project? What was your most successful contribution?

The last time I coordinated with others in a team project was an IoT group project where we made a prototype of an automatic curtain system. My most successful contribution was writing the firmware for the embedded system which was able to send and receive messages through MQTT to automatically or manually open and close the curtains.

## It is sometimes more effective to learn from others than to try to solve challenges in isolation. Share a problem-solving experience in which you applied lessons you learned from others who encountered similar problems or challenges.

During my internship, I was working on a connectivity monitor action script, which was a script written in Python that would monitor the connectivity stats of a network device. To test the script I had to grab a cluster and then be able to stream the connectivity monitor stats of devices to the cluster. Unfortunately I did not know how to stream the connectivity monitor stats so I reached out to another software engineer who already had experience doing it. He walked through it with me and in the end I was able to succesfully stream the connectivity stats to my cluster.

## What are you strongest in, accuracy or speed? Please explain with an example based on your experience.

what is this an osu question?
